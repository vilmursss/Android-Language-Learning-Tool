# Word-game for android

This is pretty basic word learning tool, but difference in this application is that you play only with the data, which you have entered by yourself!

In this release version you are able to create different kind of wordplay lists and use all CRUD functions for all words.

Game mode is funny and has three different levels, preferred by the user. In settings user is also able to set sounds on or off. Setting options uses SharedPreferences.

Wordlists will be saved to phone's memory, but highscores will be saved to FireBase, so everyone can compete and see other users's highscores.
