# Word-game for android

This is pretty basic word learning tool, but the difference in this application compared to other word learning tools is that you play only with the data, which you have entered by yourself! So you do not have to re-learn again and again and again those boooooring beginner level words in order to being able to get higher and more challenging levels.

In this release version you are able to create different kind word playing lists and use CRUD functions for all words and lists.

Game mode is funny and has three different levels preferred by the user. In settings user is also able to set sounds on or off. 

Word lists will be saved in phone's memory, but highscores will be saved to FireBase, so everyone can compete and see other users's highscores.
